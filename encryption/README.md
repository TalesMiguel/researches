# Encrypt/Decrypt

## Usage
**WARNING!** It's highly recommended to use these scripts in a safe environment. *Do not* use this in your personal computer.

### Encrypt
Use `python3 file_encrypter.py` to create a file named ***my_key.key*** and encrypt every file in the Current Working Directory.

### Decrypt
To decrypt those files, simply use `python3 file_decrypter.py`. Note that this scripts uses the ***my_key.key*** file created in the Encryption process.

## TODO
- Extract the key creation from the encrypter script for safer usage.
